                    <h3>Food for Thought</h3>
                    <p>Good nutrition is a lifestyle, not a diet. It starts with a new way of thinking about food.</p>
                    <p>Think of your body as a vehicle that uses food for fuel. Fill your tank with the right type of fuel.</p>
                    <p>Do not approach your nutrition plan as a diet plan, but rather, a lifestyle change. If you make a permanent change, you will see big results. The key to success is a daily focus on your goal.</p>
                    <p>Portion your meals and track your calories.</p>
                    <p>There are many free mobile apps available to help track your activity level and calories.</p>
                    <p>Control impulsive urges to buy junk food, and instead, allow yourself to one "cheat" meal a week.</p>
                    <p>Check out our <a href="#meal" title="links to Meal of the Week section">Meal of the Week</a> for new meal ideas.</p>

                    <p>Use the following as a guideline:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Protein, such as eggs, chicken, and lean red meat</li>
                        <li>Vegetables, but avoid corn and peas</li>
                        <li>Fruit</li>
                        <li>Fat, such as olive oil, nuts, and seeds</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Limit the consumption of bread, pasta, white potatoes, and processed food. These foods are high in carbohydrates.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When you shop for groceries, shop the outside aisles and buy organic when possible. Stock up on fresh vegetables, almond flour, and flax seed.
