    <h1>American Society for Velociraptor Attack Prevention
    </h1>
        <p>Velociraptor attack is the 3rd leading cause of death for men age 27-29. However, everyone must think about the implications of velociraptors: young and old, men, women and transgendered persons. 
        </p>
        <p>The American Society for Velociraptor Attack Prevention is a bi-partisan group of professionals, dedicated to the diffusion of knowledge concerning velociraptor attack prevention.
        </p>
    <h2>Know the Enemy
    </h2>
        <p>The velociraptor is a bipedal carnivore with a long, stiffened tail and can be distinguished from other dromaeosaurids by its long and low skull, with an upturned snout. It has a relatively large, sickle-shaped claw, typical of dromaeosaurid and troodontid dinosaurs. This enlarged claw, up to 67 millimeters (2.6 in) long around its outer edge, is a predatory device, used to tear into the prey, delivering a fatal blow. 
        </p>
        <p>Velociraptors are commonly found on tropical islands, converted to millionaire amusement parks, but are commonly being sighted in the Pacific Northwest. 
        </p>
    <h3>Essential facts you should know about velociraptors:
    </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Velociraptors hunt in packs, and are known to form an equilateral triangle around its prey.</li>
            <li>Velociraptors can accelerate 4 m/s2, with a top speed of 25 m/s on open terrain, 10 m/s while wounded, and 10 m/s in indoor laboratories. </li>
            <li>Velociraptors can open doors, but are slowed by them. They can open an initial door in approximately 5 minutes, and will take half that time for each subsequent door. </li>
            <li>Velociraptors do not know fear. </li>
        </ul>
    <h4>New Home Buyer Tips
    </h4>
        <p>When buying a new home, there are a few things to look out for when assessing potential velociraptor attacks:
        </p>
            <ol>
                <li> Check all doors and windows. Doors should be made of solid oak or steel. Windows should have steel bars with spacing smaller than the average raptor. </li>
                <li>Make sure all entryways have adequate deadbolts. Quality deadbolts may be purchased at your local Home Depot. </li>
                <li>Always keep a loaded big-game rifle under your bed, and tire irons near every door. Remember, you should never be farther than 20 feet away from a tire iron. </li>  
            </ol>
