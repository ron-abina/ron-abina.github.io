    <h3>A word from our sponsor, <a href="https://www.amctheatres.com/">AMC Theaters</a></h3>

	<p> 
		<em>"We come to this place… for magic.
        We come to AMC theaters to laugh, to cry, to care.

        Because we need that, all of us,
        that indescribable feeling we get when the lights begin to dim.
        And we go somewhere we've never been before;
        not just entertained, but somehow reborn.
        Together.

        Dazzling images, on a huge silver screen.
        Sound that I can feel.
        Somehow, heartbreak feels good in a place likе this.
        Our heroes feel like thе best part of us, and stories feel perfect and powerful.
        Because here, they are.

        AMC theaters,
        We make movies better."</em>
